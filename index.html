  <p>I have always had a love for technology and the
    ins and outs of how it works—both as individual
    devices and together as a network. My earliest
    professional experiences working with technology
    and troubleshooting started about six years ago
    in the local church when I joined the production
    team. Since, I have dived deeper in the
    technological field, receiving an A.A. degree and
    continuing education for a Bachelor's Degree in
    Computer Information and Technology with a
    Concentration in Information Assurance and a
    Minor in Web Development with Austin Peay
    State University. I look forward to putting my
    skills to work and starting a career in the field I
    know and love, while showing an employer that I
    still have room to learn and grow. I am prepared
    to give the best of my knowledge, expertise, and
    professionalism.</p>
